## Description (my words) 
A bookkeping app (using a fake data store) displays invoices in a searchable list (of links), that doubles as a dynamic navbar. App features a main content area displaying the active, selected invoice with delete-option. All done by React Routing - amazing..


## Contains
Parcel build and React Router en masse. The tutorial covers:

- Configuring Routes
- Navigating with Link
- Creating Links with active styling
- Using Nested Routes for Layout
- Navigating programmatically
- Using URL params for data loading
- Using URL Search params
- Creating your own behaviors through composition
- Server Rendering


## Build
The app is bundled with Parcel instead of CRA. To do so on Linux Manjaro, simply:

- npm install -g parcel
- npm init -y
- npm install react react-dom react-dom-router
- create appropriate files / folders in the project
- parcel index.html, and ctrl + click on 1234 port-link to open dev-browser
